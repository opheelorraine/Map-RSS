# Map-RSS
I am looking for code in Rstudio that will search for Recombination signal sequences (RSS) within a DNA sequence and give me the position.
I used count function however I cannot input multiple RSSs into it at the same time which makes it very tedious, as well I would like to create a diagram of the RSSs within gene.
RSS.R is the Rstudio file that I have done the coding in
RSS.csv is the file with the RSSs that I want to map
sequence.fasta is the cd247 fasta file
